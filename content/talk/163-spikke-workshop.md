In our field, we fancy ourselves craftsmen and -women, but there's a lot to lessons to be learned from more traditional craftsmanship.

This workshop is of a slightly different flavour, where you will learn how to whittle â€“ the art of carving wood with a knife.

This is an open workshop, where attendants may come and go as they please.
